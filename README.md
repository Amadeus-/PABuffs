#PABuffs

This repository represents my personal updates to Adelea's PABuffs addon for RIFT.   For more information on the addon (including Adelea's original release notes, information, etc.) please visit http://rift.curseforge.com/addons/pabuffs/.

I only intend to update this addon for my own personal use, and make no promises for keeping it updated in the future.   Please review the commit notes for anything that I have changed and/or added to the addon, etc.

####New Installation
1. Click the "Download Zip" button above and to the right of the list of repository files above.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to your RIFT Addons directory (typically, but not always, c:/users/USER_NAME/Documents/RIFT/Interface/Addons).   If you cannot find it, you can always start the game, and then at character select click the "Addons" button, and then when the addons window opens, click the "Open Addon Directory" button.   When you finish this step, you should have a directory like so:  .../RIFT/Interface/Addons/PABuffs-master
3. Rename the extracted directory FROM "PABuffs-master" TO "PABuffs"

####Upgrade Existing Installation
1. Click the "Download Zip" button above and to the right of the list of repository files above.
2. Go to your "PABuffs" directory (typically, but not always, c:/users/USER_NAME/Documents/RIFT/Interface/Addons/PABuffs).   If you cannot find it, you can always start the game, and then at character select click the "Addons" button, and then when the addons window opens, click the "Open Addon Directory" button.
3. Open the zip file you downloaded, and click to enter the "PABuffs-master" directory within it.   Copy everything therein to your local "PABuffs" addon directory, overwriting all files.
